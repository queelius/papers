## Challenges in Model Output and Consensus

When a model outputs a **single value**, like a number, approaches such as **LLM consensus** can be highly effective. The simplicity of the output lends itself well to aggregation techniques, where multiple outputs are compared to reach a consensus. However, when the output is a **complex structure**, like a proof or a multi-step solution, consensus becomes far more difficult. Each output is likely to be unique, and the variability in structure makes it hard to directly compare multiple outputs.

### Structured Outputs and Grammar Constraints

In certain cases, we can impose a **grammar constraint** to force outputs to conform to a specific syntax. This syntactical uniformity might reduce some of the variability in outputs, potentially leading to more consistent outputs across multiple runs. However, this approach is limited in scope. For complex reasoning tasks, even with a constrained grammar, the underlying structure of each output may still differ significantly, making consensus difficult to achieve.

## Potential Solutions

### 1. Canonical Forms

One way to manage the complexity of diverse outputs is by mapping high-dimensional outputs into **canonical forms**, which serve as lower-dimensional representations. This process is akin to classical **NLP techniques** like:
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their base or root forms.
- **Lowercasing**: Making case-insensitive comparisons.
- **Stop word removal**: Ignoring common but uninformative words (e.g., "the", "and").
- **Synonym mapping**: Converting different expressions of the same meaning into a standardized form.

The core idea is to **regularize the grammar**, creating a more uniform space for comparison. This could make consensus or verification algorithms more tractable by reducing the complexity of outputs that need to be verified. However, the high-dimensional, original outputs are retained, and the final output remains a function of those, with the canonical form serving as a tool to facilitate intermediate processing.

### 2. Reverse-Process Synthetic Data Generation

**Reverse-process synthetic data generation** can be particularly powerful in situations where solving a problem in one direction is much easier than solving it in the other. For example, in **differential equation solving**, starting from a known solution (such as an analytical form) and working backwards can generate valid problems with varying levels of complexity. This process simplifies the generation of problems that would otherwise be difficult or intractable if approached from a forward-solving perspective.

I have successfully used this approach to generate differential equation problems with solution steps of **arbitrary complexity**, with difficulty gradually increasing. This enables LLMs to learn to make predictions of proof steps, from simple to progressively harder problems. In some cases, this method even surpasses the capabilities of symbolic programs like Mathematica (based on testing). This synthetic data generation approach is **goal-driven**—starting with a solution and generating a problem—making it highly efficient for training models to reason about complex systems.

### 3. Application to Rules-Based Systems and Theorem Proving

The reverse-process synthetic data generation approach can also be applied to **rules-based systems**, including **theorem proving**. In theorem proving, we can generate new theorems by performing **random walks** through the rule space, and the resulting **proofs** are simply those random walks. The key insight here is that when the system allows, **searching backwards from the goal** is computationally equivalent to searching forward from the initial state.

#### Symmetry Breaking with Hard and Easy Rewrite Rules

However, this symmetry is **broken** when some rules are easier to apply in one direction than the other. Consider a rule \( R_i \) with an inverse rule \( R_j \), where \( R_j(R_i(x)) = x \). If moving forward from \( x \) to \( R_i(x) \) is difficult (or even intractable), but applying the inverse rule is easy, then **reverse-process techniques** are especially valuable. For example:
- In calculus, **finding derivatives** is easy, but **finding antiderivatives** is often much harder.
- In theorem proving, certain transformations may be straightforward in reverse but difficult to achieve in the forward direction.

By leveraging the easier direction (often through backward search), we can efficiently navigate the problem space, even in cases where the forward search is computationally prohibitive.

### 4. Combining Random Walks and Backward Search for Efficient Data Generation

In the context of **synthetic data generation**, we can combine two powerful ideas:
1. **Random Walks in the Search Space**: By starting from an arbitrary initial state and performing random transformations, we can generate valid problems where the endpoint is not predefined or "special." This makes both forward and backward searches linear and computationally efficient, as each transformation is relatively straightforward.
2. **Backward Search for Hard Problems**: When faced with transformations that are computationally hard to apply in a forward direction (e.g., finding antiderivatives or complex proof steps), we can perform backward search to generate the sequence of easier steps leading to a known solution. This process can then be reversed to create an efficient forward solution or proof.

This approach allows for the **generation of proofs** and solutions for complex problems in a highly efficient manner. By combining **random walks** with **backward search** for hard steps, we can generate a wide range of problems and proofs, tailored to different levels of difficulty. This flexibility makes the approach well-suited for training LLMs and other models to reason through complex, multi-step tasks.

## Conclusion

The approach of leveraging random walks and backward search in rules-based systems offers a powerful method for generating synthetic data for LLM training. By combining canonical forms for structured outputs, random walks in the search space, and backward search for computationally hard steps, this framework enables the efficient generation of data for complex problem-solving tasks. It scales well to problems of increasing difficulty, making it a valuable tool for training models to reason about hard problems across a variety of domains.
