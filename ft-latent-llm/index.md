# Introduction

In recent years, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
witnessed a remarkable evolution in the capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). These models, epitomized by systems like
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), have transformed our
approach to natural language processing (NLP), offering unprecedented
levels of fluency and versatility in language understanding and
generation. The ability of LLMs to parse, interpret, and produce
human-like text has not only advanced computational linguistics but
also opened new frontiers in AI's practical applications, ranging
from automated text generation to complex problem-solving.

Despite their impressive abilities, LLMs are not without limitations.
A significant challenge lies in the scope and depth of their training.
Traditionally, LLMs are trained on vast corpora of text data through
4methods like next-token prediction, which, while effective in
building a broad knowledge base, often do not fully equip these models
to handle contextually rich or specialized tasks. This gap is
particularly evident in scenarios requiring external knowledge
integration or step-by-step logical reasoning—areas where even the most
advanced LLMs can struggle.

This paper proposes a novel conceptual framework aimed at enhancing the
training of LLMs by integrating latent updates—a method that enriches
the training process with additional, contextually relevant information
generated by the models themselves. These latent updates can take
various forms, from generated Python code, which is externally evaluated
and then reintegrated into the model's context, to step-by-step reasoning
processes that mimic human thought patterns. By embedding these updates
into the training cycle, we hypothesize that LLMs can achieve a deeper
4understanding of context and exhibit improved performance in complex tasks.

Our objective is to outline a theoretical model for this enhanced training
approach, supported by illustrative pseudo-code and Python examples. We aim
to demonstrate how latent updates can be seamlessly integrated into existing
LLM architectures and training regimes, potentially leading to more
sophisticated and contextually aware AI systems. The remainder of this paper
is structured as follows: we first review the standard methodologies in LLM
training, followed by a detailed discussion of our proposed method, including
its theoretical underpinnings, implementation strategies, and potential
impacts on LLM training and applications.

In sum, this paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse in AI and NLP
by proposing a method that not only builds upon the existing strengths of
LLMs but also addresses some of their key limitations. Through this
exploration, we aim to pave the way for more nuanced and capable language
models, better equipped to handle the complexities and subtleties of human
language and thought.


# Background

The journey of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI has been marked
by continuous evolution, with
significant milestones shaping the current landscape. Initial efforts
in NLP were rule-based systems, focusing on parsing and pattern
matching. The emergence of statistical methods brought a shift towards
probabilistic models, leading to the first wave of machine learning
applications in language tasks.

A pivotal moment in this evolution was the introduction of the
transformer architecture, first detailed in the paper "Attention Is All
You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. This architecture, with its
self-attention mechanisms, marked a departure from previous recurrent
neural network (RNN) models. It enabled more efficient processing of
sequences and significantly improved performance in various NLP tasks.

The concept of pretraining language models on vast corpora of text data
came into prominence with models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer). These models, particularly GPT and its successors,
demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating coherent and contextually
rich text, setting new standards for language model capabilities.

LLMs have found diverse applications, ranging from generating human-like
text in chatbots to aiding in complex data analysis. Their ability to
understand and generate natural language has opened new frontiers in
technology, making AI more accessible and versatile in various domains.

This early evolution of NLP and AI, culminating in the development of
transformer-based LLMs, sets the foundation for our exploration int
enhancing these models further. The remarkable journey from rule-based
systems to sophisticated LLMs underscores the field's dynamic nature
and the continuous pursuit of more advanced and capable AI systems.

## Standard Training Methodologies for LLMs

#### Pretraining {-}

The pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) typically involves training
on extensive text corpora. This phase is crucial in developing a broad
language understanding and general world knowledge. Models like GPT-3 are
pretrained on datasets comprising a wide range of internet text. This
diverse exposure enables them to learn language structures, grammar, and a
vast array of information, laying the groundwork for their language
capabilities.

#### Fine-Tuning {-}

Post pretraining, LLMs undergo fine-tuning, a process where the model is
further trained on a more specific dataset tailored to particular tasks or
domains. This step adjusts the model to perform specialized functions, from
sentiment analysis to legal document review. Fine-tuning adapts the general
understanding acquired during pretraining to the nuances and specific
requirements of targeted applications.

#### Challenges in Training LLMs {-}

One of the critical challenges in LLM training is striking the right balance
between generalization and specialization. While pretraining offers broad
knowledge, fine-tuning must ensure that this doesn’t come at the expense of
losing the model’s ability to adapt to specific contexts. The model must
retain its general language abilities while honing its skills for specialized
tasks.

Despite their extensive training, LLMs face limitations in tasks requiring
deep contextual understanding or complex logical reasoning. They may struggle
in situations that demand integration of external knowledge or inferences
beyond the scope of their training data. This limitation is particularly
evident in scenarios that require understanding of novel concepts or complex
problem-solving.

The standard training methodologies of pretraining and fine-tuning have been
instrumental in the development of LLMs. However, the inherent challenges of
these methods, especially in terms of contextual understanding and logical
reasoning, highlight the need for innovative approaches in training. This sets
the stage for exploring the integration of latent updates as a means to bridge
these gaps and enhance the capabilities of LLMs.

# Theoretical Basis for Latent Data

Traditional LLM training methodologies, primarily based on next-token prediction,
have demonstrated significant success in various language tasks. However, these
methods often fall short in contexts requiring deep understanding or intricate
logical reasoning. This gap highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to
enrich the LLMs' training environment.

In human cognition, context plays a crucial role in understanding and responding
to language. For LLMs, contextual depth can be enhanced by incorporating additional,
relevant information that goes beyond the immediate textual data. This approach aims
to mimic the human ability to utilize background knowledge and internal reasoning in
language processing.

In the context of AI and LLMs, **latent data** refers to information that is
internally generated to aid the model's processing. That is, given a sequence 
of training tokens, the model enriches it with relevant data. This latent data
can take various forms, from the evaluation of generated code to step-by-step
reasoning processes.
The model's task is to predict the next token based on this enriched context, refining
its predictive accuracy and contextual awareness.

To find the optimal parameter $\theta$, we maximize the likelihood of the training data
given the model's predictions $Y$:
$$
\theta = \arg\max_{\theta \in \Theta} \mathcal{L}(\theta|Y),
$$
where
$$
Y = \{ \operatorname{predict}(c(X, L), \theta) : X \in D\}
$$
is the model's predictions,
$$
D = (X_1, X_2, ..., X_m)
$$
is the raw training data,
$$
X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
$$
is a sequence of tokens in the raw training data,
$$
L = \operatorname{gen\_latent}(X, \theta)
$$
is the latent data, and 
$$
c : \text{raw data} \times \text{latent data} \rightarrow \text{context}
$$
is a function that combines the latent data with the
original data in some way to provide for an enriched context.
We are interested in letting $c$ be the defined as
$$
c(X, L) = `<|latent|>` + L + `<|latent|>` + X
$$
and we are interested in a number of different latent data generation functions $\operatorname{gen\_latent}$:

- $L_{\text{code}}$: generate relevant code based on the training data, guided by the current model parameters. The code is then evaluated externally, and the output is used as the latent data.
- $L_{\text{reason}}$: generate step-by-step reasoning processes based on the training data, guided by the current model parameters. The reasoning process is then evaluated externally, and the output is used as the latent data.
- $L_{\text{pred}}$: generate predictive models or statistical inferences based on the training data, guided by the current model parameters. The predictive models are then evaluated externally, and the output is used as the latent data.

The integration of latent updates represents a significant advancement in the training of LLMs.
By enriching the model's context with internally generated, relevant information, this approach
aims to bridge the gap in complex contextual understanding and logical reasoning. This theoretical
framework sets the foundation for more sophisticated models capable of nuanced interpretation and
esponse generation in language tasks.

#### Inferences

At inference time, the model is given a sequence of tokens $X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ and is
asked to continue the sequence. It should be possible to use the same latent data generation
function $\operatorname{gen\_latent}$ as in training, since that is how the model was fine-tuned.


# Latent Data Generation Functions

When we augment the training data with the latent data, we may use various
tools to help the model generate the latent data.

## Code Generation

The first latent data generation function we consider is $L_{\text{code}}$, which generates
relevant code based on the training data, guided by the current model parameters. The code is
then evaluated externally, and the output is used as the latent data along with either
the code or a description of the code (whicih can be generated by the model itself).

### Prompt Engineering {-}

To generate any relevant code, we need to provide the model with a prompt that
guides it to generate the code that, upon evaluation, will produce the desired
latent data. The pretrained (and fine-tuned) model will already have
significant knowledge of Python, so the question is not whether it can generate
the code, but rather to use its knowledge of Python to generate appropriate
code, or none at all if it is not necessary. 
This is a non-trivial task that will require some experimentation
and problem solving.

#### Example Prompt {-}

You are an autoregressive LLM that has been fine-tuned on Python code.
You are presently being trained on a large corpus of text data, using
the semi-supervised next-token prediction task.
You will be given some raw text data, and you are asked to predict
the next token, e.g., a word or a punctuation mark.
However, it can sometimes be very difficult to accurately predict the next token,
particularly for complex tasks that require deep contextual understanding
or algorithmic reasoning, such as mathematical or logical computations. In
these cases, it may be easier to generate Python code
that can be evaluated externally, and the output of the code can be used
as the latent data along with other supplementary information, such as
the python code itself and a description of the code.

Let's work on an example to show how this works.
Suppose we have the following text:

`<text>`
The names of the students are John, Mary, and Peter. John its 15 years old,
Mary is 16 years old, and Peter is 17 years old. Their average age is
`</text>`

You are asked to generate the next token. In order to do so, you may
be inclined to generate the Python code:

`<python>`
```python
peter = 17
mary = 16
john = 15
average_age = mean([peter, mary, john])
print(average_age)
```
`</python>`

An external Python interpreter will evaluate the code, producing
the output:

`<output>`
```
16
```
`</output>`

We prepend this information to the original text, which hopefully provides
it with an enriched context in which to more successfully predict the
next token in the original text. Here is what the enriched latent context
might look like:

`<text>`
`<latent>`
Here is some python code that may help with the next token prediction task.
`<python>`
```python
peter = 17
mary = 16
john = 15
average_age = mean([peter, mary, john])
print(average_age)
```
`</python>`
`<output>`
```
16
```
`</output>`

Recall that the data generating process of reality is impossibly
complex, and the output provided by this code is only an approximation
of the true output. Keep in mind the larger context of the original raw
data, and only use this information to help you predict the next token.
`</latent>`
The names of the students are John, Mary, and Peter. John its 15 years old,
Mary is 16 years old, and Peter is 17 years old. Their average age is
`</text>`

The model will then likely predict the next token, which is probably `16`.
Of course, sometimes, it may be the case that the raw text provides a different
continuation, like `given by 16` or even a mathematically incorrect continuation,
like `17`. If this is the case, the model will be penalized for its incorrect
prediction, and so the task is to let this inform your next-token prediction
task, but to also learn to ignore the output or only use it as an additional
contextual data point (maybe it is close to 16, for instance).

# Future Work

We would like to entertain more sophisticated latent data generation functions $\operatorname{gen\_latent}$.
We are particularly interested in *tree-of-thought* generation, where the latent data is a tree of
thoughts that the model can use to guide its predictions. In this way, we can fine-tune the
LLM to consider many possible paths of reasoning, and the model can choose the most appropriate
path based on the context. This approach is inspired by the human ability to consider multiple
paths of reasoning and choose the most appropriate one based on the context. We believe that
this approach will lead to more sophisticated models capable of advanced system 2 thinking.
