# Spatial-Visual-Language (SVL) Model

## Overview

This experimental project explores the integration of language with visual-spatial-action tokens to enhance spatial reasoning in AI models. Utilizing Andrej Karpathy's lightweight model, nanogpt, our focus is on generating synthetic training data that combines natural language with custom tokens representing visual-spatial scenarios and actions.

## Project Description

We aim to develop a model capable of not only processing and predicting natural language but also incorporating a series of visual-spatial-action tokens to represent and predict complex spatial concepts. This integration allows the model to generate context-rich predictions, including text and corresponding spatial-visual tokens, providing a deeper understanding of spatially oriented narratives and descriptions.

### Key Features

- **Utilization of nanogpt**: A small-scale, efficient Transformer model for handling multimodal data.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creating a diverse dataset that combines linguistic descriptions with visual-spatial and action tokens.
- **Embedding Space Integration**: All tokens, whether language or visual-spatial, are embedded in the same space, allowing for nuanced context representation and prediction.

### Example Use-Cases

- Text generation that inherently understands and incorporates spatial concepts.
- Predictive modeling for scenarios that involve spatial reasoning and dynamics.

## Getting Started
